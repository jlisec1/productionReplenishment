# mfgScripts
I would like to use this repository to store ion-interaction scripts. I would eventually like to get to the point where there is one file that stores all of the graphql queries and one that a user can interact with, telling the script which query it would like to run.

I'm going to start by adding the disassembly script

Requirements

User will need the following to run the disassembly script:

aws IAM credentials
a configured aws command line interface (CLI)
